<p style="font-size:1vw">"Art and the internet" discusses on various types of arts from the late 1990s. <br>Discussed art types include :  Screenbased arts, Collaborative work of art through data exchange, expressionist art through cameras <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37681006">(Jennicam) </a> </p> 
<h2>Alexei Shulgin : "The globality of net has made it possible for anyone to have a massive audience with no institutional endorsement"

 <p>The given reading shows a clear indication of challenges in the internet art due to the growing technologies and replacements of prior platforms like shockwave and flash. An example provided is the work of the artist Douglas Davis whose work was restored, revised to be presented in the <a href="https://whitney.org/"> Whitney Museum </a> due to the fact that the newer technologies were unable to present his work. Similarly, the reading also focuses on the curators and questions whether internet art as a collaborative process might not reflect the intention of the original curators. Additionally, various works of art are also shown in the reading such as, art of showing daily lives through webcam <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37681006"> (Jennicam)</a> and redefining sexuality (Issac Leung) "I'm an oriental whole" - 2003. More importantly, I also found it interesting that the reading brings forth examples of the CCTV surveillance which is mentioned as a different form of capturing one's daily life. In addition to CCTV surveillance, an example provided is of Beijing where 15 surveillance cameras we kepts for a house arrest of Ai Weiwei in 2012 and during the times that Weiwei started to lifecast his cameras were forced to shutdown. This points into the various data privacy issues and concerns regarding Government control, mass surveillance that are of major discussion in the current times. Lastly, in "In between" by Domenico Quaranta she explains about net art and how easy it is to publish as well as create art due to the technological advancements.
