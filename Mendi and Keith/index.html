		 <p align="center"> <li> Obadike focused on the selling points of blackness but then juxtaposed it with <br> “warnings” of the drawbacks of owning a black <br>identity. </p> </li>
		 <li>Told to remove due to inappropirateness</li> <br>
		 <li>It was the Obadike’s aim to address the many ways blackness<br> has been commodified — alluding to similarities  <br>to that of a slave auction- and how it is seen<br> often as a vague concept separate from the black body. </li>
