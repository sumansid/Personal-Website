	Hello there,<br>
		I am Suman Sigdel from Nepal and I'm currently studying computer science at Bennington College, Vermont. Before this, I studied IB diploma in UWC ISAK JAPAN for 3 years. I am very interested in crypto currencies, economics, programming and software development. After the Nepal earthquake 2015, I started <a href="https://www.isakpronepal.org"> ISAK's Project Nepal </a> in high school and raised over $100,000 to rebuild schools, healthposts in Nepal. Through the project I also worked with the Japanese Government to send a Mobile clinic to Nepal with the ODA (Official Development Aid) fund.You can find me on instagram on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sumantrades" >@sumantrades </a> and also on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/shillonmusk"> twitter </a>.
